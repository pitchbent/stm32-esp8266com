# stm32-esp8266com
Coding part for my bachelor thesis. It is all about implementing reliable, secure communication inbetween those two processors and enabling a path to the internet. The STM32 does the "heavy lifting" and communication with external periphals, while the ESP8266 cares about the connection to the internet. The communication inbetween the processors is encrypted using the XTEA algorithm.
